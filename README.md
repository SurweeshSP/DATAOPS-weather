# DATAOPS-weather 

## Overview
**DATAOPS-weather** is a practical end-to-end project designed to apply **DataOps principles** for handling real-time and historical weather data.  
It combines **data engineering, machine learning, and automation pipelines** to extract, transform, load (ETL), and analyze weather datasets, enabling predictive insights.

The goal is to simulate how DataOps concepts can be implemented for real-world scenarios such as **climate trend analysis**, **flood forecasting**, or **agriculture planning**.

---

## Concepts Covered
This project reinforces the following core concepts:

### **1. DataOps Principles**
- Automating data workflows from collection to delivery.
- Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) for data.
- Monitoring, validation, and version control for datasets.

### **2. Data Engineering**
- Data ingestion from APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, NOAA) and CSV/JSON sources.
- Cleaning and transforming raw weather data.
- Structuring datasets for analysis and storage.

### **3. Workflow Orchestration**
- **Apache Airflow** for scheduling ETL tasks.
- Containerized execution using **Docker** for portability.

### **4. Deployment**
- Version control using **Git/GitHub**.
- Optional cloud integration (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
- API-based prediction endpoint using **Flask/FastAPI**.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection**
   - Fetch historical & live weather data from APIs.
   - Store datasets in CSV or a database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values, unit conversions, and outliers.
   - Feature engineering for model input (e.g., temperature trends, seasonal indicators).

3. **Data Pipeline Automation**
   - Build DAGs in Apache Airflow to automate:
     - Fetch → Clean → Train → Predict → Store.
   - Run workflows daily/hourly.

4. **Deployment**
   - Serve predictions via REST API.
   - Visualize insights with a dashboard (Streamlit/React).

By completing this project, you will gain:
- **Practical DataOps experience**: managing data lifecycle, CI/CD pipelines.
- **Real-world ML deployment** skills.
- Understanding of **ETL** in a production environment.
- Familiarity with **Airflow DAGs** and **Dockerized pipelines**.
- Weather data domain knowledge (patterns, anomalies, forecasting).
- Collaboration best practices using GitHub.
